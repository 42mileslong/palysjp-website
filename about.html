    <h6>What is Social Justice?</h6>
    <p> Social justice can be defined as both a state and a process.</p>
    <p>Social justice is the state in which individuals recieve and practice the human rights and privileges that all should have in terms of wealth, stability, education, opportunites, and happiness.</p>  
    <p>Social justice is a process of building the steps to a completely just society. This can be done by instituting government policies, carrying out community intervention, and individual intervention.</p>
