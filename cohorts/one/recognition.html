<h3>Recognition</h3>
SJP is honored to have received so much attention this past year. We would like to thank all of the interviewers, journalists, and kind collaborators who have spread word of our program. We have also received amazing and thoughtful letters from author Isabel Allende and Senator Dianne Feinstein. We hope that our program will continue to inspire others and spread justice throughout our community and other communities.
