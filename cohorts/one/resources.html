<p>The Social Justice Pathway Summit was created to share our opinion of what social justice is to our class. Our summit is a discussion between five class delegates to convey our definition of social justice to the public and what our class aims to do to help the community to incorporate social justice. In our discussion we focus on the prevalence of social justice in our community, absence and presence of social justice on our school campus, how the public middle schools feed into the high schools and affects the diversity in friend groups in the schools. We prepared for our summit by forming groups of four in our class and designating a delegate to Collaborate with researchers who provided data collected from the community. These delegates then discussed their topics with each other based off of the research their team did.</p>
